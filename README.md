# Project name: 
Smart Alerting System for Fall Detection.

# Project Description: 
Nowadays Senior Citizens and disabled people can overcome their disabilities in 
carrying out daily tasks in many facilities. But they have trouble being independently 
mobile and sometimes they fall, and due to delay in late treatment after fall it increases the 
chances of severe injuries. Hence keeping this in mind an idea to develop a fall detection 
system emerged. This report mainly focuses on the problem we discussed. In recent years, 
artificial intelligence techniques have shown a remarkable detection of human fall in 
comparison to traditional techniques. Human Fall detection systems aim to reduce both 
dependency and care costs in the elderly community.  

The proposed system consists of three stages namely pose estimation, fall detection, 
and alarming system. This system exceptionally proves itself better than existing solutions 
because no physical devices will be used. For eg. Smart Watches, Wrist Bands. Also, other 
available systems monitor only a single person in frame whether this system works for 
more than one person too. In the second stage i.e fall detection a comparison between 
different pose detection models was made to find and provide the best suited solution for 
the problem. In the proposed system Smart Alarming System plays the final and most 
essential role as it will to convey about the detected fall to the userâ€™s relatives or caregivers 
to provide the treatment.
